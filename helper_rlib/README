# What's this?

A helper project to build rlibs for the `compile` project. Stored artifacts
then by hand should be copied into `compile` from `target` directory.
Those are used as `extern crate`s and since there's no Cargo to help us,
we currently provide our own prebuilt versions of corresponding crates.
Up until there's more production-ready way that automates this...
